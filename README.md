## Technical Architecture

### Core Stack
- **Backend**: Node.js with TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
- **Caching & Real-time**: Redis
- **Websockets**: Socket.io for real-time communication
- **Authentication**: JWT with OAuth 2.0 support (Google/GitHub)

### Key Components

#### User Authentication System
- Email/password authentication
- OAuth integration with Google and GitHub
- OTP verification for email validation
- Session management with device tracking

#### Matchmaking Service
- Dynamic rating-based opponent matching
- Adjustable rating ranges based on queue time
- Real-time match creation and management
- Multiple game modes

#### Rating System
- ELO-style rating calculations
- Initial ratings based on self-reported skill level:
  - BEGINNER: 800
  - INTERMEDIATE: 1200
  - PRO: 1600
- K-factor of 32 for rating adjustments
- Dynamic skill level reassignment based on performance

#### Code Execution System
- Serverless execution via AWS Lambda
- Job queue management with BullMQ
- Sandboxed environments for secure code testing
- Time and memory limit enforcement

#### Contest Management
- Full contest lifecycle management (creation, running, completion)
- Problem creation and management
- Participant registration and tracking
- Real-time leaderboard updates
- Contest-specific submissions and scoring

## API Structure

The API is organized into several major modules:

- **Auth**: User registration, login, OAuth, and session management
- **User**: Profile management, skill updates, submissions history
- **Match**: Real-time match creation, game state management, submissions
- **Contest**: Contest creation, management, participation, and submissions
- **Dashboard**: Stats, leaderboards, and user performance metrics
- **Admin**: Administrative functions for platform management

## Socket Events

Real-time functionality is implemented via Socket.io events:

- Matchmaking events (join queue, match found)
- Game events (start, state updates, submission results)
- Player events (join, disconnect, reconnect)
